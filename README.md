##People&Fire: Reducing Risk, Living with Risk

This project aims at refocusing the wildfire problem by assuming that many of those practices are rational within the current policy and socioeconomic setting. People&Fire: Reducing Risk, Living with Risk.

Description
Understanding people’s current choices and how policy can actually change them is key to design effective risk-reduction policies.

Study area
The study area used to develop and test the analytical framework is the region of Pinhal Interior, a hilly region where forest and scrubland dominate the land cover, forest ownership is very-small-scale, population density is low and people live in dispersed settlements, as ‘islands in a forest sea’.

This was one of the most seriously hit areas in the wildfires of 2017.

This project will advance the state of the art mostly through expanding the interdisciplinary boundary of the scientific knowledge about wildfires and wildfire policy, by linking together those 3 key scientific areas, in addition to the abovementioned, more specialized innovations.

Results
The main result of the proposed research is a tested new analytical framework (https://nmileu.github.io/peopleandfire/) to support the development and evaluation of new, integrated and people-centred policy approaches to wildfires.

A policy brief, a decision-support platform and several guidelines for best practices on adaptation and emergency self-defensive strategies will be produced.
